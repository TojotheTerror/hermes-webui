# Agent instructions for Hermes WebUI

This file is the shared entry point for AI assistants working in this
repository. Keep it project-specific and safe to publish. Do not put personal
machine setup, private network details, credentials, tokens, or local-only
workflow notes here.

## Read first

Before making changes, read:

1. `README.md`
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md`
3. `docs/CONTRACTS.md`
4. `CHANGELOG.md`

For architecture, testing, or setup work, also read the matching reference:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for design constraints and current module layout
- `TESTING.md` for local verification commands and manual test guidance
- `docs/onboarding.md` for first-run onboarding behavior
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` for diagnostic flows
- `docs/rfcs/README.md` for larger RFCs and state/durability contracts

For UI or UX work, read `docs/UIUX-GUIDE.md` and `DESIGN.md` before
changing layout, interaction flow, themes, chat rendering, or composer chrome.

## Hermes Android / Mobile Client track

Hermes Android work is remote-first unless an issue explicitly says otherwise.
The Android surface is a mobile PWA or app wrapper that connects to a
workstation-hosted Hermes WebUI / Hermes Agent runtime. Do not attempt to embed
or port the full Hermes Agent runtime, Python environment, local tools, or model
execution onto Android in ordinary Hermes Android tasks.

Repository ownership for this track:

- `TojotheTerror/hermes-webui` is the writable home for PWA, mobile UI, remote
  access docs, Android wrapper docs, and WebUI behavior.
- `TojotheTerror/hermes-agent` is writable only for explicitly scoped
  runtime/API changes that cannot be solved in WebUI.
- Upstream repositories such as `NousResearch/hermes-agent` and
  `NousResearch/hermes-webui` are read/reference only. Never push branches,
  commits, tags, issues, labels, pull requests, releases, workflow changes, or
  project metadata to upstream repositories.

When an upstream checkout is useful for comparison, configure it as fetch-only.
Local clones should disable upstream pushes, for example:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-webui.git
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED
```

All implementation branches for this project must live in a `TojotheTerror/*`
fork. Prefer branch names under `hermes-android/` or `codex/hermes-android/`.
Any command, tool call, automation, or Codex action that would write to an
upstream `NousResearch/*` repository must stop before execution and report the
unsafe target.

Human review is required before changes that affect authentication, CSRF,
service-worker caching rules, remote exposure defaults, runtime/API boundaries,
Android signing/distribution assets, or project automation hooks.

## Onboarding and reinstall support

If the task involves install, reinstall, bootstrap, first-run onboarding,
provider setup, local model server setup, Docker onboarding, WSL onboarding, or
support for a failed first run, read `docs/onboarding-agent-checklist.md`
before running commands or inspecting logs.

Follow that checklist's safety rules:

- use isolated `HERMES_HOME` and `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` for trials unless the
  human explicitly asks to use real state
- do not delete or overwrite a real `~/.hermes` directory without explicit
  approval
- do not print API keys, OAuth tokens, cookies, full `.env` files, full
  `auth.json` files, or password hashes
- collect non-secret status and log evidence before recommending a fix

## Contribution style

- Keep one logical change per PR; split unrelated refactors or cleanup.
- Read `docs/CONTRACTS.md` and the linked contract/RFC for the touched
  subsystem before editing.
- For local pytest runs, use `./scripts/test.sh` instead of bare `python3`,
  `python -m pytest`, or `pytest`. The script creates/uses the repo `.venv`,
  pins execution to Python 3.11-3.13, and installs missing dev test dependencies.
  `HERMES_WEBUI_TEST_PYTHON` selects the supported base interpreter used to
  create or rebuild `.venv`; it must not install test dependencies into a
  system/Homebrew interpreter directly.
  If a direct pytest invocation reports an unsupported interpreter, rerun through
  `./scripts/test.sh` before debugging product code.
- Prefer the existing Python + vanilla JavaScript structure. Do not add
  dependencies, build tools, frameworks, or long-lived processes without clear
  justification and a rollback story.
- Update docs when changing setup, onboarding, runtime behavior, architecture,
  testing guidance, or user-facing workflows.
- Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` in ordinary contributor PRs. The release workflow
  owns changelog updates through release commits. If a change is release-note
  worthy, include concise release-note wording in the PR body instead.
- For UI or UX changes, include before/after evidence and test relevant
  desktop, narrow, and mobile states.
- For behavior changes, add or update automated tests where practical and list
  the manual verification performed.
- For runtime, streaming, recovery, replay, compression, or sidebar metadata
  changes, name the state layer being mutated and prove the relevant invariant.
- For Docker build changes in `docker_init.bash`, mirror directory exclusions
  in both the `rsync` and `cp -a` paths — `/opt/hermes` may contain subdirectories
  with restricted permissions (e.g. `.playwright/`).

## Local state and secrets

Hermes WebUI can read and write real agent state, sessions, workspaces,
credentials, and cron data. Treat local validation as potentially destructive
unless you have confirmed the active state directories.

Prefer isolated trial state for experiments:

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/tmp/hermes-webui-agent-home \
HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR=/tmp/hermes-webui-agent-state \
HERMES_WEBUI_PORT=8789 \
python3 bootstrap.py
```

Do not include private machine instructions in this tracked file. Use a
git-ignored local note for personal workflow details.
